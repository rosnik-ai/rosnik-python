      a cosmic tune,\nIn this celestial orchestra, their voices sweetly attune.\n\nIn
      their lunar playground, they navigate with grace,\nBounding over craters and
      leaving paw prints in a starry trace,\nEvery leap, a testament, that dreams
      can reach the moon,\nAn ode to furry fearless explorers, who inspire us to swoon.\n\nOh,
      dogs on the moon, let your spirits always soar,\nA testament to the boundless
      love and loyalty we adore,\nMay your adventure inspire, with each bark and playful
      zoom,\nA celestial symphony, created by dogs on the moon."}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":27,"completion_tokens":259,"total_tokens":286}}
